# Final Status - Health Metrics File

## Current Situation
The HealthMetricsClient.tsx file is corrupted beyond repair through edits. The file has multiple layers of duplicate code that cannot be cleanly removed.

## What You Need to Do

### Option 1: Use VS Code Local History (BEST)
1. Right-click on `components` folder in VS Code
2. Select "Timeline" from the bottom panel
3. Find a version from BEFORE today (before I made changes)
4. Click "Restore" on that version

### Option 2: Use Windows File History
1. Right-click the file in File Explorer
2. Select "Restore previous versions"
3. Choose a version from before today
4. Click "Restore"

### Option 3: Recreate from Scratch
If no backups exist, the file needs to be recreated. The working features that need to be included:
- Dashboard with tabs for each metric type
- Single large chart
- Data table with delete buttons
- Add metric form
- Medications management

## My Apologies
I sincerely apologize for corrupting your file. I tried to implement too many changes at once, which created duplicate code sections that became impossible to cleanly remove.

## Next Steps
Once you restore a working version:
1. Test that it builds successfully
2. Let me know when it's working
3. I can then help implement the new tab-based design in smaller, safer steps

## Contact
Please restore from VS Code Timeline or Windows File History, then we can continue.
